Files of various types can be uploaded to Plone web sites.

Choose file in the *Add new...* menu for a folder to upload a file:



.. code:: robotframework
   :class: hidden

   *** Test Cases ***

   Show add files menu
       Go to  ${PLONE_URL}

       Wait until element is visible
       ...  css=span.icon-plone-contentmenu-factories
       Click element  css=span.icon-plone-contentmenu-factories
       Wait until element is visible
       ...  css=#plone-contentmenu-factories li.plone-toolbar-submenu-header

       Mouse over  file

       Capture and crop page screenshot
       ...  ${CURDIR}/../../_robot/adding-files_add-menu.png
       ...  css=div.plone-toolbar-container
       ...  css=#plone-contentmenu-factories ul

.. figure:: ../../_robot/adding-files_add-menu.png
   :align: center
   :alt: add-new-menu.png

Select **File** from the drop-down menu, and you'll see the *Add File* panel:



.. code:: robotframework
   :class: hidden

   *** Test Cases ***

   Show new file add form
       Page should contain element  file
       Click link  file

       Wait until element is visible
       ...  css=#form-widgets-title

       Capture and crop page screenshot
       ...  ${CURDIR}/../../_robot/adding-files_add-form.png
       ...  css=#content

   :alt:

Click the *Browse* button to navigate to the file you want to upload from your local computer. Provide a title (you can use the same file name used on your local computer if you want).
Provide a *description* if you want. When you click the save button the file will be uploaded to the folder.



Example file types include PDF files, Word documents, database files, zip files... -- well, practically anything.
Files on a Plone web site are treated as just files and will show up in contents lists for folders, but there won't be any special display of them.
They will appear by name in lists and will be available for download if clicked.

There are specialized add-on tools for Plone web sites that search the content of files, or can provide a preview of for instance PDF or Office files.
If you are interested in this functionality, ask your Plone web site administrator.
